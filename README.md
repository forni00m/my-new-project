# Changing weekly menus

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Weekly menus make it easy to plan your meals for the week. When you plan your menus well in advance, you may well eat leftovers from the previous day for several days or continue the next day’s meal with them. With the help of the menu, you plan varied and affordable meals for each day of the week. For example, planning a week’s meals in advance saves time and effort. The basic ingredients can be obtained on a single shopping trip and replenished with fresh produce during the week.


## Background

The six-week menu is designed according to the main ingredient. There is planned one main meal a day is planned for the  list, as usually the second meal is eaten at the school, or workplace. The menu becomes varied, as vegetarian, fish, meat and other dishes alternate on different days of the week. The menu gives you plenty of choice as the recipes can vary according to your preference. The menu is designed so that on weekends the same food is eaten for lunch as for the previous day’s dinner. This reduces cooking work.

The benefits of weekly planning:
* Save time
* Reduce food waste
* Helps you eat healthier

Often on one- or three-week menus, the rotation of the same portions of food begins to get tired, and six-week menus provide more options.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
